What is NativeBase?\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a sleek, ingenious and dynamic front-end framework created by passionate React Loving team at [Geekyants.com](https://geekyants.com/) to build cross platform Android & iOS mobile apps using ready to use generic components of React Native.\n\n\n\n## 2. Why NativeBase?\nWhat is really great with [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is that you can use shared UI cross-platform components, which will drastically increase your productivity. When using NativeBase, you can use any native third-party libraries out of the box.<br />\n\n**Recommended by** *Microsoft*\n> If you're looking to get started with React Native + CodePush, and are looking for an awesome starter kit, you should check out Native Starter Pro - [Microsoft's react-native-code-push repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/react-native-code-push#example-apps--starters)\n\n**Recommended by [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)**\n>NativeBase added into the list of [Frameworks](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native#frameworks) of Awesome React Native and are also used by many other React lovers across the world.\n\n\n## 4. Getting Started\n\n**a. Setup with pure React Native app**\n\n*Install NativeBase*\n\n```js\nnpm install native-base --save\n```\n*Install Peer Dependencies*<br />\nThe peer dependencies included from any npm packages does not automatically get installed. Your application will not depend on it explicitly.\n\n```js\nreact-native link\n```\n\nYou've successfully setup [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) with your [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app. Your React Native app is now all set to run on iOS and Android simulator.\n\n\n**b. Setup with Expo**\n\nExpo helps you make React Native apps with no build configuration. It works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. <br />\nRefer this link for additional information on [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)\n\n*Install NativeBase*\n```js\nnpm install native-base --save\n```\n\n<br />\n\n**Note** <br />\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) uses some custom fonts that can be loaded using **Font.loadAsync**. Check out the [Expo Font documentation](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/font/).\n<br />\n\n*Install Expo Fonts*\n```bash\nexpo install expo-font\n```\n\n*App.js* <br />\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { AppLoading } from 'expo';\nimport { Container, Text } from 'native-base';\nimport * as Font from 'expo-font';\nimport { Ionicons } from '@expo/vector-icons';\n\nexport default class App extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      isReady: false,\n    };\n  }\n\n  async componentDidMount() {\n    await Font.loadAsync({\n      Roboto: require('native-base/Fonts/Roboto.ttf'),\n      Roboto_medium: require('native-base/Fonts/Roboto_medium.ttf'),\n      ...Ionicons.font,\n    });\n    this.setState({ isReady: true });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (!this.state.isReady) {\n      return <AppLoading />;\n    }\n\n    return (\n      <Container>\n        <Text>Open up App.js to start working on your app!</Text>\n      </Container>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n<br />\n\nCheck out the [KitchenSink](https://expo.io/@geekyants/nativebasekitchensink) with Expo for an example of the implementation.<br />\nFind the [KitchenSink repo here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/tree/CRNA)\n\n**c. Setup with ignite-native-base-boilerplate**\n\nYou can run the following command to create the boilerplate, provided you have [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) installed.\n\n```\nignite new appname --boilerplate native-base-boilerplate\n```\nGo to app location\n```sh\ncd appname\n```\nFor iOS run\n```sh\nreact-native run-ios\n```\nFor Android run\n```sh\nreact-native run-android\n```\nRefer [ignite-native-base-boilerplate](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/ignite-native-base-boilerplate) page for additional information\n\n## 5. Components\n\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is made from effective building blocks referred to as components. The Components are constructed in pure [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) platform along with some JavaScript functionality with rich set of customisable properties. These components allow you to quickly build the perfect interface.\n\n## 6. NativeBase for Web\n\nNativeBase is now available for React web lovers. Check the [demo](https://nativebase.io/kitchen-sink-web-app/)\nFind the repo [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase-KitchenSink/tree/web-support)\n\n\n## 7. Compatibility Versions\n\n| NativeBase   |      React Native      |\n|----------|-------------|\n| v0.1.1\t| v0.22 to v0.23 |\n| v0.2.0 to v0.3.1 | v0.24 to v0.25 |\n| v0.4.6 to v0.4.9 | v0.26.0 - v0.27.1 |\n| v0.5.0 to v0.5.15 | v0.26.0 - v0.37.0 |\n| v0.5.16 to v0.5.20 | v0.38.0 - v0.39.0 |\n| v2.0.0-alpha1 to v2.1.3 | v0.38.0 to v0.43.0 |\n| v2.1.4 to v2.1.5 | v0.44.0 to v0.45.0 |\n| v2.2.0 | v0.44.0 to v0.45.0 |\n| v2.2.1 | v0.46.0 and above |\n| v2.3.0 to 2.6.1 | v0.46.0 and above *(does not support React 16.0.0-alpha.13)*|\n| v2.7.0 | v0.56.0 and above |\n\n## 8. [React Native Seed](https://reactnativeseed.com/)\n\n\nReact Native Seed provides you React Native starter kits for your base app with the technologies that you love.\n\nBased on the feedback we received from our users, people had trouble sorting out the right boilerplate for them with the desired technologies and contacted us to enquire. We realized that many people were particular about the technologies they want in the app and that a minimal, neat solution was required to solve this, and hence, React Native Seed.\n\nReact Native Seed is for learners and professionals alike, those who want to experiment, learn all aspects and those who already know enough, just want a starter kit to quickly start working on their project.\n\n\n## 9.
